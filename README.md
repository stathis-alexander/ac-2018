Advent of Code

These are my solutions to Advent of Code. I do not submit these as best or efficient solutions. Often times I am trying to
complete the puzzles as simply and in as little time for me as possible. Everything is very hacky and probably not great code.


Things learned so far:
- general python familiarity
- basic git
- with _ as _ in python, some minor list comprehension
